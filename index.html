Nomenclature is consistent with <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.811.28712">Weimars et al. (2018)</a> but we have included those few sub-species which have very divergent traits from the nominate species. <br><br>Trait definitions are available <a href="traitvariabledefinitions.pdf" download>here.</a> We do not include biotope occupancy as a trait in our database as life-history traits, basic morphology, resource-use and behaviour are good predictors of biotope occupancy in butterflies.<br><br>
The database provides a critical resource for improving our understanding of fundamental processes such as how traits define species co-occurrences and their responses to environmental change, their spatial dynamics, and their associations with vegetation structures.

<br><br>The dataset, whilst comprehensive, has some missing information on some traits for some species, especially for those which are highly restricted in their distributions. We welcome additional data and comments on the current dataset.<br><br>
